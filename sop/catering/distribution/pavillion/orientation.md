PURPOSE: Familiarize yourself with setup and running of a pavilion for Camporama

## This Guide

This guide contains the following

* Basic overview of running a pavilion
* Meal outlines and serving work sheets
* Instructions/Policies
* FAQ
* Forms you will need 

## Organization

The food service group for camporama has the following organization:

* Food Service Coordinator - Overseas all food service activities, kitchen, pavilions etc.

* Distribution Coordinator - Oversees food delivery and pavilions

* Pavilion Manager - Oversees individual pavilion
 

## Meetings

There will be a pavilion manager meeting at 10:00am every day after breakfast in the Johnnie Barnes Lodge Kitchen. Its to the discretion of the Food Service Coordinator to move or alter this meeting as they see fit.

## Pavilion

The pavilion is the core of the food service operation, its the most visible part of the operation to campers, its vital we provide good service, quickly, to each diner.

## Supplies

For the duration of the camp, any dry goods necessary to food service should be stored at your pavilion (Silverware, Napkins,etc). Take a moment and find them if you haven't already.

### Re-Ordering / Inventory

Please take a inventory of supplies every day, even though everything should be present for the entire event, mistakes can happen. If you find yourself low on supplies. Fill out a order form (See appendix) and provide it to a delivery truck when they drop off or pick up supplies.

## Staffing

With the exception of the pavilion manager and perhaps one other volunteer each meal will see new volunteers for service.

The pavilion manager (pm) must staff following positions for each service:

 * Tag Scanner (1) - capture campers information as they come in.
 * Replenisher (2 min) - Brings more food from hot storage, drinks from reefer,etc - IMPORTANT this person keeps everything running, they have to hustle!
 * Section Chief (2) - This role will oversee 2 serving lines ea and also help replenish/coordinate.
 * Servers 8-12 - depending on the meal.

### Pre-Service

Before volunteers arrive:

 * Please ensure you have napkins, plates, etc for serving - contact dist. immediately if you do not.
 * Sufficient drinks - same as above.
 * Review the meal plan for that meal, i.e. what are you serving and how.
 * Change setup as necessary (Breakfast Primarily)

### Pre-Meal Orientation

Conduct a pre-meal orientation with volunteers, do the following during this meeting:

* Greet volunteers, thank them for their efforts
* Assign roles (as above)
* Cover where things should be placed when food is delivered, ie drinks in cooler, hot food carriers plugged in against back wall,etc.
* Conduct quick training with each role
* Demonstrate sample plate as in meal guide for servers
* Cover what to do after meal, ie close lines as things slow, do cleanup etc.
* Answer other questions

**NOTE:** This is a balancing act, some volunteers will be late, try to not wait to the last minute while not missing so many volunteers that you have to repeat yourself.


## Food Receiving

Approximately 30 minutes before a meal service you should receive volunteers, 15 minutes after that you should receive food delivery from the kitchen. Due to the tight deadlines you should already have sorted out where volunteers will move things. At this point you've received hot food, please try to start serving as soon as possible.

**Reference the section on setup/serving for that particular meal IE Tue/Breakfast**

### Roles

#### Tag Scanner 

See the section on tag scanning, in a pinch you can get someone from the end of the meal line to come up and scan, have them switch out with someone else when their group gets to the front of the line. Its a easy way to get another volunteer if you are short handed.


##### Line Cards

Line cards are small business cards that have a entry for start/end time for those in line. Randomly give these to diners as they enter the line.
The scanner should write down the time as soon as they receive the card.  You should do this several times during meal service.

#### Replenisher

This person needs to know how to hustle, they will bring forward new trays of food for line servers, more drinks from coolers,etc. Their head needs to be on a swivel.

#### Section Chief 

Similar to the replenisher they will oversee 2 serving lines and communicate what they need from the replenisher.

The purpose of this role is so line servers never move from their station and keep serving.


#### Pavilion Manager

This person oversees the service and makes sure everyone has what they need. 

They SHOULD NOT

* Act as a tag scanner
* Be doing individual serving (other than in a pinch and temporarily)

They SHOULD

* Head of issues before they start
* Help with replenishment
* Answer questions for campers
* Communicate any issues with the kitchen during service.

## Post Meal

After each meal, the service team should cleanup, and pack any kitchen items up for sending back to the kitchen for cleaning.

Send any unused items received back to the kitchen every service.  The exception to this is drinks and ice cream.

The ice cream should be covered in cardboard.

## Sanitation

See the section on sanitation

## Feedback

See an issue during or before service that is minor?  The time to bring that up is DIRECTLY after that meal service, we are serving 70,000+ meals for Camporama and we won't do it again for 4 years, if we can improve something during the event we will put forth a best effort. That said do not deviate from policies until you've spoken to the food service coordinator or distribution manager.
