# Camper Tag Scanners

PURPOSE: Familiarize yourself with the scanning system

## Scanner Software

The scanner software is written specifically for Camporama, it features one input field for the code on the campers tag and a button "check"  

If a camper has not been through the line then a message saying "Good Scan" will appear on a green background.

If the camper has been through the line already then a message saying "Camper has already been served" on a red background will be displayed and a "buzzer" sound will play

The software provides the last 10 scans so you can see if you have double scanned a tag.

## Barcode Scanners

The scanners you will use are wireless and other than being plugged into the laptops provided don't need anything done with them. They have a 30ft range so please do not move farther way than that from the laptop

## Use

To start the software on the desktop of the laptop, click the "Meal Scan" icon. You are set to go.

## Operating process

The scanning system sends scans to the kitchen live, it allows the kitchen to see the speed of people going through the line as well as collect service statistics. Should there be any issue with the network, the software stores this data on the local computer.

## After Use

Place the laptop in the provded storage bin, plug in the scanner to charge for the next meal.
