# Saniation and Surface Cleaning

PURPOSE: To prevent foodborne illness by ensuring that all food contact surfaces are
properly cleaned and sanitized.

SCOPE: This procedure applies to foodservice involved in cleaning and
sanitizing food contact surfaces.

KEY WORDS: Food Contact Surface, Cleaning, Sanitizing

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Train foodservice on using the procedures in this SOP.
2. Follow State or local health department requirements.
3. Follow manufacturer’s instructions regarding the use and maintenance of equipment
and use of chemicals for cleaning and sanitizing food contact surfaces. Refer to
Storing and Using Poisonous or Toxic Chemicals SOP.
4. If State or local requirements are based on the 2001 FDA Food Code, wash, rinse, and
sanitize food contact surfaces of sinks, tables, equipment, utensils, thermometers,
carts, and equipment:
  * Before each use
  * Between uses when preparing different types of raw animal foods, such as eggs,
fish, meat, and poultry
  * Between uses when preparing ready-to-eat foods and raw animal foods, such as
eggs, fish, meat, and poultry
  * Any time contamination occurs or is suspected
5. Wash, rinse, and sanitize food contact surfaces of sinks, tables, equipment, utensils,
thermometers, carts, and equipment using the following procedure:
  * Wash surface with detergent solution.
  * Rinse surface with clean water.
  * Sanitize surface using a sanitizing solution mixed at a concentration specified on
the manufacturer’s label.
  * Place wet items in a manner to allow air drying. 

6. If a 3-compartment sink is used, setup and use the sink in the following manner:
  * In the first compartment, wash with a clean detergent solution at or above 110 oF
or at the temperature specified by the detergent manufacturer.
  * In the second compartment, rinse with clean water.
  * In the third compartment, sanitize with a sanitizing solution mixed at a
concentration specified on the manufacturer’s label or by immersing in hot water
at or above 171 o
F for 30 seconds. Test the chemical sanitizer concentration by
using an appropriate test kit.
7. If a dishmachine is used:
  * Check with the dishmachine manufacturer to verify that the information on the
data plate is correct.
  * Refer to the information on the data plate for determining wash, rinse, and
sanitization (final) rinse temperatures; sanitizing solution concentrations; and
water pressures, if applicable.
  * Follow manufacturer’s instructions for use.
  * Ensure that food contact surfaces reach a surface temperature of 160 o
F or above

if using hot water to sanitize.
MONITORING:
Foodservice will:
1. During all hours of operation, visually and physically inspect food contact surfaces of
equipment and utensils to ensure that the surfaces are clean.
2. In a 3-compartment sink, on a daily basis:
  * Visually monitor that the water in each compartment is clean.
  * Take the water temperature in the first compartment of the sink by using a
calibrated thermometer.
  * If using chemicals to sanitize, test the sanitizer concentration by using the
appropriate test kit for the chemical.
  * If using hot water to sanitize, use a calibrated thermometer to measure the water
temperature. 
3. In a dishmachine, on a daily basis:
  * Visually monitor that the water and the interior parts of the machine are clean and
free of debris.
  * Continually monitor the temperature and pressure gauges, if applicable, to ensure
that the machine is operating according to the data plate.
  * For hot water sanitizing dishmachine, ensure that food contact surfaces are
reaching the appropriate temperature by placing a piece of heat sensitive tape on a
smallware item or a maximum registering thermometer on a rack and running the
item or rack through the dishmachine.
  * For chemical sanitizing dishmachine, check the sanitizer concentration on a
recently washed food-contact surface using an appropriate test kit.
