### Controlling Time and Temperature During Preparation

PURPOSE: To prevent foodborne illness by limiting the amount of time that
potentially hazardous foods are held in the temperature danger zone during preparation.

SCOPE: This procedure applies to foodservice employees who prepare food.

KEY WORDS: Cross-Contamination, Time and Temperature Control, Food
Preparation, Temperature Danger Zone

#### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Train foodservice employees on using the procedures in this SOP. Refer to the Using and Calibrating Thermometers SOP.
2. Follow State or local health department requirements.
3. Wash hands prior to preparing foods. Refer to the Washing Hands SOP.
4. Use clean and sanitized equipment and utensils while preparing food.
5. Separate raw foods from ready-to-eat foods by keeping them in separate containers until ready to use and by using separate dispensing utensils. Refer to the Preventing Cross-Contamination During Storage and Preparation SOP.
6. Pre-chill ingredients for cold foods, such as sandwiches, salads, and cut melons, to 41 ÂºF or below before combining with other ingredients.
7. Prepare foods as close to serving times as the menu will allow.
8. Prepare food in small batches.
9. Limit the time for preparation of any batches of food so that ingredients are not at room temperature for more than 30 minutes before cooking, serving, or being returned to the refrigerator.
10. If potentially hazardous foods are not cooked or served immediately after preparation, quickly chill. Refer to the Cooling Potentially Hazardous Foods SOP.

#### MONITORING:

1. Use a clean, sanitized, and calibrated probe thermometer, preferably a thermocouple.
2. Take at least two internal temperatures from each pan of food at various stages of preparation.
3. Monitor the amount of time that food is in the temperature danger zone. It should not exceed 4 hours.

#### CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:

1. Retrain any foodservice employee found not following the procedures in this SOP.
2. Begin the cooking process immediately after preparation is complete for any foods that will be served hot.
3. Rapidly cool ready-to-eat foods or foods that will be cooked at a later time.
4. Immediately return ingredients to the refrigerator if the anticipated preparation completion time is expected to exceed 30 minutes.
5. Discard food held in the temperature danger zone for more than 4 hours.

#### VERIFICATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
Foodservice employees will record the date, product name, start and end times of production, the two temperature measurements taken, any corrective actions taken, and the amount of food prepared on the Production Log. The foodservice manager will verify that foodservice employees are taking the required temperatures and following the proper preparation procedure by visually monitoring foodservice employees during the shift and reviewing, initialing, and dating the Production Log daily. Maintain the Production Log as directed by your State agency. The foodservice manager will complete the Food Safety Checklist daily.
