## Holding Hot and Cold Potentially Hazardous Foods

PURPOSE: To prevent foodborne illness by ensuring that all potentially hazardous
foods are held under the proper temperature.

SCOPE: This procedure applies to foodservice employees who prepare or serve food.

KEY WORDS: Cross-Contamination, Temperatures, Holding, Hot Holding, Cold
Holding, Storage

#### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Train foodservice employees on using the procedures in this SOP. Refer to the Using
and Calibrating Thermometers SOP.
2. Follow State or local health department requirements.
3. If State or local health department requirements are based on the 2013 FDA Food Code:
  * Hold hot foods at 135 ºF or above
  * Hold cold foods at 41 ºF or below
4. Preheat steam tables and hot boxes.

#### MONITORING:

1. Use a clean, sanitized, and calibrated probe thermometer to measure the temperature
of the food.
2. Take temperatures of foods by inserting the thermometer near the surface of the
product, at the thickest part, and at other various locations.
3. Take temperatures of holding units by placing a calibrated thermometer in the coolest
part of a hot holding unit or warmest part of a cold holding unit.
4. For hot foods held for service:
  * Verify that the air/water temperature of any unit is at 135 ºF or above before use.
  * Reheat foods in accordance with the Reheating for Hot Holding SOP.
  * All hot potentially hazardous foods should be 135 ºF or above before placing the food out for display or service.
  * Take the internal temperature of food before placing it on a steam table or in a hot holding unit and at least every 2 hour thereafter.
5. For cold foods held for service:
  * Verify that the air/water temperature of any unit is at 41 ºF or below before use.
  * Chill foods, if applicable, in accordance with the Cooling Potentially Hazardous Foods SOP.
  * All cold potentially hazardous foods should be 41 ºF or below before placing the food out for display or service.
  * Take the internal temperature of the food before placing it onto any salad bar, display cooler, or cold serving line and at least every 2 hours thereafter.
6. For cold foods in storage:
  * Take the internal temperature of the food before placing it into any walk-in cooler or reach-in cold holding unit.
  * Chill food in accordance with the Cooling Potentially Hazardous Foods SOP if the food is not 41 ºF or below. 
  * Verify that the air temperature of any cold holding unit is at 41 ºF or below before use and at least every 4 hours thereafter during all hours of operation.

#### CORRECTIVE ACTION:

1. Retrain any foodservice employee found not following the procedures in this SOP.
2. For hot foods:
  * Reheat the food to 165 ºF for 15 seconds if the temperature is found to be below 135 ºF and the last temperature measurement was 135 ºF or higher and taken within the last 2 hours. Repair or reset holding equipment before returning the food to the unit, if applicable.
  * Discard the food if it cannot be determined how long the food temperature was below 135 ºF.
3. For cold foods:
  * Rapidly chill the food using an appropriate cooling method if the temperature is found to be above 41 ºF and the last temperature measurement was 41 ºF or below and taken within the last 2 hours:
  * Place food in shallow containers (no more than 4 inches deep) and uncovered on the top shelf in the back of the walk-in or reach-in cooler. 
  * Use a quick-chill unit like a blast chiller.
  * Stir the food in a container placed in an ice water bath.
  * Add ice as an ingredient.
  * Separate food into smaller or thinner portions.
4. Repair or reset holding equipment before returning the food to the unit, if applicable.
5. Discard the food if it cannot be determined how long the food temperature was above 41 ºF.
