## HACCP-Based SOPs
Date Marking Ready-to-Eat, Potentially Hazardous Food
(Sample SOP)

PURPOSE: To ensure appropriate rotation of ready-to-eat food to prevent or reduce
foodborne illness from Listeria monocytogenes.

SCOPE: This procedure applies to foodservice employees who prepare, store, or serve
food.

KEY WORDS: Ready-to-Eat Food, Potentially Hazardous Food, Date Marking, CrossContamination

### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Train foodservice employees on using the procedures in this SOP. The best practice
for a date marking system would be to include a label with the product name, the day
or date, and time it is prepared or opened. Examples of how to indicate when the
food is prepared or opened include:
* Labeling food with a calendar date, such as “cut cantaloupe, 5/26/05, 8:00 a.m.,”
* Identifying the day of the week, such as “cut cantaloupe, Monday, 8:00 a.m.,” or
* Using color-coded marks or tags, such as cut cantaloupe, blue dot, 8:00 a.m.
means “cut on Monday at 8:00 a.m.”
2. Follow State or local health department requirements.
3. Label ready-to-eat, potentially hazardous foods that are prepared on-site and held for
more than 24 hours.
4. Label any processed, ready-to-eat, potentially hazardous foods when opened, if they
are to be held for more than 24 hours.
5. Refrigerate all ready-to-eat, potentially hazardous foods at 41 ºF or below.
6. Serve or discard refrigerated, ready-to-eat, potentially hazardous foods within 7 days.
7. Indicate with a separate label the date prepared, the date frozen, and the date thawed
of any refrigerated, ready-to-eat, potentially hazardous foods.
8. Calculate the 7-day time period by counting only the days that the food is under
refrigeration. For example:
* On Monday, 8/1/05, lasagna is cooked, properly cooled, and refrigerated with a
label that reads, “Lasagna, Cooked, 8/1/05.”
* On Tuesday, 8/2/05, the lasagna is frozen with a second label that reads, “Frozen,
8/2/05.” Two labels now appear on the lasagna. Since the lasagna was held
under refrigeration from Monday, 8/1/05 – Tuesday, 8/2/05, only 1 day is counted
towards the 7-day time period.

(Sample SOP)

INSTRUCTIONS, continued:
* On Tuesday 8/16/05 the lasagna is pulled out of the freezer. A third label is
placed on the lasagna that reads, “Thawed, 8/16/05.” All three labels now appear
on the lasagna. The lasagna must be served or discarded within 6 days.

MONITORING:
A designated employee will check refrigerators daily to verify that foods are date marked
and that foods exceeding the 7-day time period are not being used or stored.

CORRECTIVE ACTION:
1. Retrain any foodservice employee found not following the procedures in this SOP.
2. Foods that are not date marked or that exceed the 7-day time period will be discarded.
