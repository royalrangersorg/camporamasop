3. Schedule deliveries to arrive at designated times during operational hours.
4. Post the delivery schedule, including the names of vendors, days and times of deliveries, and drivers’ names.
5. Establish a rejection policy to ensure accurate, timely, consistent, and effective refusal and return of rejected goods.
6. Organize freezer and refrigeration space, loading docks, and store rooms before deliveries.
7. Gather product specification lists and purchase orders, temperature logs, calibrated thermometers, pens, flashlights, and clean loading carts before deliveries. Refer to the Using and Calibrating Thermometers SOP.
8. Keep receiving area clean and well lighted.
9. Do not touch ready-to-eat foods with bare hands.
10. Determine whether foods will be marked with the date arrival or the “use by” date and mark accordingly upon receipt.
11. Compare delivery invoice against products ordered and products delivered.
12. Transfer foods to their appropriate locations as quickly as possible.

#### MONITORING:
1. Inspect the delivery truck when it arrives to ensure that it is clean, free of putrid odors, and organized to prevent cross-contamination. Be sure refrigerated foods are delivered on a refrigerated truck.
2. Check the interior temperature of refrigerated trucks.
3. Confirm vendor name, day and time of delivery, as well as driver’s identification before accepting delivery. If driver’s name is different from what is indicated on the delivery schedule, contact the vendor immediately.
4. Check frozen foods to ensure that they are all frozen solid and show no signs of thawing and refreezing, such as the presence of large ice crystals or liquids on the bottom of cartons.
5. Check the temperature of refrigerated foods.
  a. For fresh meat, fish, and poultry products, insert a clean and sanitized thermometer into the center of the product to ensure a temperature of 41 ºF or below. The temperature of milk should be 45 ºF or below.
  b. For packaged products, insert a food thermometer between two packages being careful not to puncture the wrapper. If the temperature exceeds 41 ºF, it may be necessary to take the internal temperature before accepting the product.
  c. For eggs, the interior temperature of the truck should be 45 ºF or below.
6. Check dates of milk, eggs, and other perishable goods to ensure safety and quality.
7. Check the integrity of food packaging.
8. Check the cleanliness of crates and other shipping containers before accepting products. Reject foods that are shipped in dirty crates.
