### Reheating Potentially Hazardous Foods

PURPOSE: To prevent foodborne illness by ensuring that all foods are reheated to the
appropriate internal temperature.

SCOPE: This procedure applies to foodservice employees who prepare or serve food.

KEY WORDS: Cross-Contamination, Temperatures, Reheating, Holding, Hot Holding

#### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Train foodservice employees on using the procedures in this SOP. Refer to the Using
and Calibrating Thermometers SOP.
2. Follow State or local health department requirements.
3. If State or local requirements are based on the 2001 FDA Food Code, heat processed, ready-to-eat foods from a package or can, such as canned green beans or prepackaged breakfast burritos, to an internal temperature of at least 135 ºF for 15 seconds for hot holding.
4. Reheat the following products to 165 ºF for 15 seconds:
  * Any food that is cooked, cooled, and reheated for hot holding
  * Leftovers reheated for hot holding
  * Products made from leftovers, such as soup
  * Precooked, processed foods that have been previously cooled
5. Reheat food for hot holding in the following manner if using a microwave oven:
  * Heat processed, ready-to-eat foods from a package or can to at least 135 ºF for 15 seconds
  * Heat leftovers to 165 ºF for 15 seconds
  * Rotate (or stir) and cover foods while heating
  * Allow to sit for 2 minutes after heating
6. Reheat all foods rapidly. The total time the temperature of the food is between 41 ºF and 165 ºF may not exceed 2 hours.
7. Serve reheated food immediately or transfer to an appropriate hot holding unit.

#### MONITORING:
1. Use a clean, sanitized, and calibrated probe thermometer.
2. Take at least two internal temperatures from each pan of food.

#### CORRECTIVE ACTION:
1. Retrain any foodservice employee found not following the procedures in this SOP.
2. Continue reheating and heating food if the internal temperature does not reach the
required temperature.

#### VERIFICATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
Foodservice employees will record product name, time, the two temperatures/times, and
any corrective action taken on the Cooking and Reheating Temperature Log.
Foodservice manager will verify that foodservice employees have taken the required
reheating temperatures by visually monitoring foodservice employees during the shift and
reviewing, initialing, and dating the Cooking and Reheating Temperature Log at the close
of each day.
